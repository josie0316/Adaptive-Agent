# Experimental Statement
## 1. Purpose
You have been asked to participate in a research study that studies human-AI coordination. We would like your permission to enroll you as a participant in this research study.

The instruments involved in the experiment are a computer screen and a keyboard. The experimental task consisted of playing  the computer game Overcooked and manipulating the keyboard to coordinate with the AI agent to cook and serve dishes.

## 2. Procedure
In this study, you need to read the experiment instructions and make sure you understand the content of the experiment. The entire experiment process lasts approximately **30 minutes**. After reading and signing the experiment instructions, the experiment is divided into the following steps:

(1) Fill in demographic information;

(2) Carefully read the game guide we provide to understand how to play the game and the kind of interactions and communication you need with the agent. Also, adjust the height of your chair, your sitting posture, and the distance between your eyes and the screen to ensure a comfortable position throughout the experiment;

(3) **Trial Play**: You will first try out the game controls you learned in the tutorial during a trial game and familiarize yourself with the game mechanics;

(4) **Level Testing**: After warming up, you will play a formal single-player game on your own to help us calibrate your level of gameplay. Please try to achieve the highest score possible;

(5) **Formal Experiment**:In the formal experiment, you will be matched with an AI agent as your teammate in each game. Your goal is to collaborate with the AI agent to achieve the highest possible score.
Throughout the experiment, you will play a total of eight games, partnering with four different agents, each for two consecutive games. **The four agents are distinguished by hat colors: red, green, pink, and orange. The order in which these agents appear is randomized, but each agent will always be paired with you for two consecutive games.**
After completing two games with an agent, you will be asked to rank its performance, including its capability and your preference for the agent. Once all games are completed, you will have the opportunity to review and adjust your rankings if necessary. Please remember the hat colors representing different agents during the games to assist you in providing accurate evaluations.

***Please note that all ratings and questions are mandatory; do not skip any.***

## 3. Risks and Discomforts
The only potential risk factor for this experiment is trace electron radiation from the computer. Relevant studies have shown that radiation from computers and related peripherals will not cause harm to the human body. If you feel uncomfortable, you can stop participating at any time.

## 4. Costs
Each participant who completes the experiment and fills correct individual information will be paid 50 ~ 65 RMB according to your performance.

## 5. Confidentiality
The results of this study may be published in an academic journal/book or used for teaching purposes. However, your name or other identifiers will not be used in any publication or teaching materials without your specific permission. In addition, if photographs, audio tapes or videotapes were taken during the study that would identify you, then you must give special permission for their use.

I confirm that the purpose of the research, the study procedures and the possible risks and discomforts as well as potential benefits that I may experience have been explained to me. All my questions have been satisfactorily answered. I have read this consent form. Clicking the button below indicates my willingness to participate in this study
